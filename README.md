## Features

- Modern Angular 18 with standalone components and signals
- Responsive design (Bootstrap 5)
- Modular state management (@ngrx/component-store)
- Mock API with json-server
- Unit tests for all major logic

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (optional, for local development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/leonardosr/gog-cart-assignment.git
    cd gog-cart-assignment
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Mock API with `json-server`

- The app uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to mock backend API calls.  
- A sample `_db.json` file is provided in the project root as a template.  
- Copy or rename it to `db.json` before starting the server.  
- If you need to restore the initial data, use `db_bkp.json`.

```sh
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```
or
```sh
npm run json-server
```

- The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.
- You can edit `db.json` to change the product catalog or cart data.
- You can use the `db_bkp.json` file to restore the initial data.

### 2. Start the Angular Application

In a new terminal window/tab:

```sh
npm start
```
or
```sh
ng serve
```

- The app will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Testing

- Run all unit tests: `npm test`
- Coverage reports are generated in `/coverage`
- Tests cover components, pipes, store logic, and utility functions

## Notes

- The application uses Angular signals and standalone components (Angular 18).
- State management is handled with `@ngrx/component-store`.
- Styling uses Bootstrap 5 with custom theme overrides.
- The mock API (`json-server`) is required for full functionality.
